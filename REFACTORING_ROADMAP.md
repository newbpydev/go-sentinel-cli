## 📋 Architectural Analysis Summary

### Current Issues Identified

**File Size Issues:**
- `processor.go`: 835 lines (needs split into 4-5 files)
- `app_controller.go`: 492 lines (needs reorganization)
- `failed_tests.go`: 509 lines (needs extraction)
- `watch_runner.go`: 373 lines (consolidation needed)

**Duplication Areas:**
- Watch logic spread across 3+ files
- Display formatting scattered across multiple files
- Configuration handling mixed with business logic
- Test running logic duplicated in multiple runners

**Package Boundary Issues:**
- All logic in single `internal/cli` package
- No clear separation of concerns
- Mixed responsibilities in single files
- Difficult to test components in isolation

### Target Architecture Benefits

**Clear Package Structure:**
```
internal/
├── app/          # Application orchestration
├── watch/        # File watching system
├── test/         # Test execution & processing
├── ui/           # User interface components
└── config/       # Configuration management

pkg/
├── events/       # Event system
└── models/       # Shared data models
```

**Improved Testability:**
- Dependency injection with interfaces
- Isolated components for unit testing
- Clear boundaries for integration testing
- Mocked dependencies for fast tests

**Better Maintainability:**
- Single responsibility principle
- Small, focused files (≤ 200 lines)
- Clear dependency graphs
- Easy to extend and modify
