### âœ… Task 5: Set up automated code quality checks (COMPLETED)
**Status**: 100% Complete  
**Completion Date**: [Current]

**Achievements**:
- **Quality Gate Script**: Created comprehensive `scripts/quality-gate.sh` with 7-step pipeline:
  1. Module validation (`go mod tidy`, `go mod verify`)
  2. Code formatting (`go fmt` with auto-fix)
  3. Static analysis (`go vet`)
  4. Linting (golangci-lint with fallback to go vet)
  5. Security scanning (gosec with proper configuration)
  6. Test execution with coverage reporting (excluding stress tests)
  7. Build validation (both CLI versions)

- **Enhanced CI/CD Pipeline**: Updated `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with:
  - Multi-platform testing (Ubuntu, Windows, macOS)
  - Comprehensive quality checks
  - Coverage reporting with thresholds
  - Security scanning with SARIF output
  - Artifact generation and caching

- **Improved Configuration**:
  - Fixed `.golangci.yml` configuration for current version compatibility
  - Enhanced `.pre-commit-config.yaml` with comprehensive hooks
  - Updated `Makefile` with quality gate integration

- **Quality Standards**:
  - Coverage threshold: 90% (currently 35.5% - improvement needed)
  - Security scanning with gosec (zero issues found)
  - Automated formatting and linting
  - Race condition detection and fixes

- **Integration**:
  - Makefile commands: `make quality-gate`, `make quality-gate-setup`
  - Pre-commit hooks for local development
  - GitHub Actions for CI/CD automation
  - Comprehensive reporting (HTML coverage, JSON security reports)
