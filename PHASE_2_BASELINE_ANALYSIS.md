# üìä Phase 2: Baseline Analysis Report

> CLI v2 Refactoring - Watch Logic Consolidation

## üéØ Phase 2 Objectives

**Objective**: Eliminate duplication in watch-related functionality and create a unified watch system.

**Current State**: Multiple watch components with overlapping responsibilities spread across 3+ files
**Target State**: Clean, modular watch system with clear separation of concerns

## üìÅ Current Watch Component Inventory

### Existing Watch-Related Files
Located in `internal/cli/`:

#### üîç Primary Watch Components
1. **`watcher.go`** - Core file system watching functionality
   - File system event monitoring
   - Path filtering and exclusion logic
   - Basic event generation

2. **`watch_runner.go`** (373 lines) - Watch execution and coordination
   - Test execution triggering
   - Watch mode orchestration
   - Integration with test runners

3. **`watch_integration.go`** - Integration and coordination logic
   - Cross-component integration
   - Workflow coordination
   - State management

#### üîÑ Supporting Watch Components
4. **`debouncer.go`** - File change debouncing
   - Event temporal grouping
   - Duplicate event filtering
   - Timer management

5. **`app_controller.go`** (492 lines) - Contains watch orchestration
   - High-level watch coordination
   - Mode switching logic
   - Application lifecycle management

## üß© Duplication Analysis

### Identified Overlapping Functionality

#### File Watching Logic Duplication
- **File system monitoring** appears in multiple components
- **Path filtering** logic scattered across files
- **Event generation** patterns repeated
- **Configuration handling** mixed throughout

#### Test Triggering Duplication
- **Test execution logic** in multiple runners
- **Package resolution** repeated patterns
- **Result processing** scattered across components
- **Error handling** inconsistent patterns

#### Watch Mode Handling
- **Mode switching** logic in app_controller and watch_runner
- **State management** scattered across multiple files
- **Configuration parsing** repeated in different contexts
- **Lifecycle management** inconsistent patterns

## üéØ Target Architecture Analysis

### Proposed Package Structure
Based on roadmap Phase 2 objectives:

```
internal/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ watch/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ core/           # Foundational interfaces and types
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ watcher/        # File system monitoring
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ debouncer/      # Event temporal processing
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ integration/    # Watch system coordination
```

### Interface Boundaries to Extract

#### Core Watch Interfaces Needed
1. **`FileWatcher`** - File system monitoring contract
2. **`EventProcessor`** - Event processing and filtering
3. **`TestTrigger`** - Test execution triggering
4. **`WatchCoordinator`** - Overall watch system coordination

#### Dependencies to Identify
- Watch components ‚Üí Test execution system
- Watch components ‚Üí Configuration system  
- Watch components ‚Üí UI/Display system
- Watch components ‚Üí Cache system

## üìä Current Architecture Issues

### File Size and Complexity Issues
| File | Lines | Issues | Refactoring Priority |
|------|-------|---------|---------------------|
| `watch_runner.go` | 373 | Multiple responsibilities | High |
| `app_controller.go` | 492 | Watch logic mixed with app logic | High |
| `watch_integration.go` | ~200 | Integration complexity | Medium |
| `watcher.go` | ~150 | Tightly coupled to specific implementations | Medium |

### Responsibility Overlap
- **Watch triggering** spans multiple components
- **Configuration handling** scattered across watch files
- **Error handling** inconsistent across watch system
- **Lifecycle management** mixed with business logic

### Testing Challenges
- **Difficult to isolate** watch components for unit testing
- **Complex setup required** for integration testing
- **Race conditions** in watch event processing
- **Mock complexity** due to tight coupling

## üéØ Phase 2 Action Plan

### 2.1 Watch Component Analysis (Tasks 1-3)
- [ ] **Inventory watch files**: Document functionality in each watch-related file
- [ ] **Identify shared interfaces**: Extract common contracts between components
- [ ] **Map dependencies**: Document how watch components interact

### 2.2 Core Watch Architecture (Tasks 4-6)  
- [ ] **Create `internal/watch/core`**: Define foundational interfaces and types
- [ ] **Implement `internal/watch/watcher`**: File system monitoring functionality
- [ ] **Create `internal/watch/debouncer`**: Event debouncing logic

### 2.3 Watch Integration Refactoring (Tasks 7-9)
- [ ] **Consolidate watch runners**: Merge overlapping execution logic
- [ ] **Implement watch modes**: Separate WatchAll, WatchChanged, WatchRelated logic  
- [ ] **Create watch configuration**: Centralized configuration management

## üìà Success Metrics for Phase 2

### Quantitative Targets
- **File Count Reduction**: 3+ watch files ‚Üí Organized package structure
- **Code Duplication**: Eliminate 50%+ of duplicated watch logic
- **Test Coverage**: Maintain ‚â• 61.6% while refactoring
- **Cyclomatic Complexity**: Reduce complexity in watch components

### Qualitative Goals
- **Clear Separation**: Each package has single, well-defined responsibility
- **Interface Contracts**: Clean abstractions between watch components
- **Testability**: Easy to unit test each watch component in isolation
- **Configuration**: Centralized, consistent watch configuration management

### Quality Gates
- **All Tests Pass**: No regressions during refactoring
- **Linting Clean**: Zero new linting issues introduced
- **Performance**: No degradation in watch system performance
- **Documentation**: All new interfaces and packages documented

## üîç Pre-Refactoring Analysis Required

### Files to Analyze in Detail
1. **`internal/cli/watcher.go`** - Core watching functionality
2. **`internal/cli/watch_runner.go`** - Execution coordination
3. **`internal/cli/watch_integration.go`** - Integration patterns
4. **`internal/cli/app_controller.go`** - Watch orchestration sections
5. **`internal/cli/debouncer.go`** - Event processing logic

### Dependencies to Map
- Watch system ‚Üí Test runner integration
- Watch system ‚Üí Configuration management
- Watch system ‚Üí UI/Display coordination
- Watch system ‚Üí Cache system interaction

### Interface Extraction Candidates
- File system monitoring interfaces
- Event processing contracts
- Test triggering abstractions
- Configuration management interfaces
