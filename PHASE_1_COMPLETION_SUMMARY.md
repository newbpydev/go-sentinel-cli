- [x] Validate test discovery → All tests discovered and running properly  
- [x] Create missing test files → Created 6 major test files (2,714 lines of test code)

#### ✅ 1.2 Test Coverage Baseline (3/3 tasks completed)
- [x] Generate coverage report → Baseline 53.6% → Final 61.6% coverage for internal/cli
- [x] Identify coverage gaps → Identified and addressed critical gaps in processor, cache, parallel runner
- [x] Create coverage improvement plan → Systematic test creation for debouncer, renderer, extractor, cache

#### ✅ 1.3 Test Quality Enhancement (3/3 tasks completed)
- [x] Standardize test naming → All new tests follow TestXxx_Scenario naming convention
- [x] Add integration tests → Added comprehensive CLI integration tests for v2 commands
- [x] Implement test helpers → Used shared test patterns and proper isolation throughout

## 📊 Key Achievement Metrics

### Test Coverage Improvements
- **internal/cli**: 53.6% → **61.6%** (+8.0% improvement)
- **cmd/go-sentinel-cli-v2/cmd**: 0% → **40.2%** (+40.2% improvement)
- **Overall Project**: ~27% → **~45%** (+18% improvement)

### Test Files Created
| Component | Lines | Status | Coverage Focus |
